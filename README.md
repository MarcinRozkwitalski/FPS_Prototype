# FPS_Prototype
## Project completed within a week. 
The main goal of this project was to allow the player to inflict damage on various objects using different weapons (one melee and two firearms). 

During the development, I applied design patterns I learned during a course, enabling me to create a code structure that is both readable and scalable. 

I also aimed to deliver high-quality animations, sound, and gameplay mechanics, which I successfully achieved.
